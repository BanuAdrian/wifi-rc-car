# Wi-Fi Remote Controlled Car

## Introduction

This project represents a four-wheeled car controlled via Wi-Fi, implementing various functions such as a horn, acceleration sound, obstacle avoidance, headlights, taillights, and more.

The idea is rooted in my childhood passion for toy cars, with my favorites being those that could be controlled remotely. I often imagined the moment when I would get my driverâ€™s license and be able to drive in real life. However, I would feel sad whenever the remote control broke, but it gave me the opportunity to take the cars apart using a screwdriver and admire the components inside, without necessarily understanding them.

I believe this project is valuable because it offers a great way to turn a childhood passion into a tangible creation that blends nostalgia with innovation. For others, it could serve as an inspiration to bring their ideas to life. Additionally, since this project is essentially a toy, it has the potential to bring excitement and joy for those who interact with it, no matter their age.
