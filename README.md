# Wi-Fi Remote Controlled Car

## Introduction

This project represents a four-wheeled car controlled via Wi-Fi, implementing various functions such as a horn, acceleration sound, obstacle avoidance, headlights, taillights, and more.

The idea is rooted in my childhood passion for toy cars, with my favorites being those that could be controlled remotely. I often imagined the moment when I would get my driverâ€™s license and be able to drive in real life. However, I would feel sad whenever the remote control broke, but it gave me the opportunity to take the cars apart using a screwdriver and admire the components inside, without necessarily understanding them.

I believe this project is valuable because it offers a great way to turn a childhood passion into a tangible creation that blends nostalgia with innovation. For others, it could serve as an inspiration to bring their ideas to life. Additionally, since this project is essentially a toy, it has the potential to bring excitement and joy for those who interact with it, no matter their age.

### Car Features

- It can be controlled via Wi-Fi, either on a phone or a laptop. 
- It uses 4 TT Gear Motors connected to the L298N Driver Module, which is powered by 2x Li-Ion 18650 batteries. The driver uses 6 pins of the ESP32, 2 of which need to be connected to PWM pins (EN1 and EN2 pins, which control the speed of the motors). As a note, the first 4 pins of the board from the left side (34, 35, 36, 39) are input only pins and can't be configured as output, so I used the pins starting from the next available one (32). 
- Due to the 5V regulator of the module, it can output 5V, which is used not only for the ESP32 board, but also for other modules. 
- Its steering works similarly to the tank steering system (i.e. accelerating one side while the opposite is standing still or reversing). 
- It uses the GP2Y0A21YK0F Infrared Distance Sensor for obstacle avoidance (i.e. it will reverse when it detects a potential collision), which is connected to ADC channel 1 (pin 35). As a note, ADC channel 2 is used by the Wi-Fi driver of the ESP32, so those pins can't be used for this purpose.
- It has a speaker attached to it, so it can play different sounds (horn, acceleration etc.). In order to do so, the microcontroller is connected to a Mini Audio Amplifier based on PAM8403 using DAC1 (pin 25) and, in order to store sounds files, also communicates with a MicroSD module using SPI (pins 5 - CS, 18 - SCK, 19 - MISO, 23 - MOSI).
- It has taillights and headlights represented by two pairs of LEDs. Only two pins are needed (pins 16, 17) since the respective lights will turn on and off simultaneously.
